        Demo for manuscript titled "Institution-wide shape analysis of 3D spinal curvature and
global alignment parameters", under review in Journal of Orthopaedic Research. Spine shape demo hosted on gradio at <a href="https://gradio.app/g/iriondo/spine_demo">gradio.app/g/iriondo/spine_demo</a>. Currently, only dicom images are supported as the image preprocessing pipeline uses intensity, FOV, and pixel spacing information from the image header. This API is for demonstration purposes only, any data run through the demo must be fully anonymized, and users hereby certify that they are in compliance with HIPAA and their institutional policies.
